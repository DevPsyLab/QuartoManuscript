# Intro

This is a starter file for your "Computational Notebook" script.
This script be used to run analyses using the data file(s).
This script should be separate from the "Prepare Data" file that is used for update the data file(s).
Every time you run the "Computational Notebook" file with the exact same data, you should get the exact same findings (i.e., reproducibility).
Thus, we keep the "Prepare Data script" separate from the "Computational Notebook" file so that you update the data only when you intend to.

This document is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) Notebook, which is an example of a computational notebook.

This document is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) Notebook.
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
This allows you to share your analyses and results with others so that they can see the results in line with the code for reproducibility.
Make sure to have only one sentence per line.
For more information on the value of computational notebooks, see the article titled "[The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)".
